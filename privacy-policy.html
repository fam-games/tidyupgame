                <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 14, 2025</p>
                <p><strong>Developer / Publisher:</strong> M. Furkan Bilgi</p>

            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>TIDY UP! is a family-friendly app designed for children (ages 3–7) to play together with a parent/guardian. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and when we share it.</p>

            <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect and process only the data needed to provide the app's core features.</p>

            <h3>2.1 Account Data (Google Sign-In)</h3>
            <p>If you choose to sign in with Google Sign-In, we may collect and store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic account identifiers needed to authenticate you (e.g., Google user ID)</li>
                <li>Email address (to identify your account and support account management)</li>
                <li>Profile info you allow Google to share (e.g., name and profile photo, if provided by Google and permitted by you)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not ask for your password; authentication is handled by Google.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Photos / Images (Camera — AI Features)</h3>
            <p>If you use AI-powered features (e.g., generating an item list from a room photo, creating a story, or generating questions), the app processes a photo taken with the camera.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not permanently store photos.</li>
                <li>The photo is used to generate the requested result, then deleted from the app flow after processing (including any temporary copies created for the request, as applicable).</li>
                <li>We do not store room photos on our own servers.</li>
                <li>The photo (and a prompt) is transmitted to a third-party AI service provider (OpenAI API) to generate a text response.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="important-box">
                <strong>Important:</strong> Photos may accidentally include personal information (faces, names, addresses, or other sensitive details). We recommend capturing only what is necessary for gameplay and avoiding faces or identifying information.
            </div>

            <h3>2.3 In-App Purchases (Google Play Billing)</h3>
            <p>If you purchase AI usage rights or other in-app items:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The purchase is processed by Google Play.</li>
                <li>We may receive purchase verification information (e.g., purchase token/receipt status) to grant and manage entitlements.</li>
                <li>We do not collect or store your full payment card details.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.4 Microphone & Speech Recognition (Math Mode)</h3>
            <p>In Math Mode, the app may request access to your device's microphone so the user can speak an answer aloud.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> App functionality (speech-to-text recognition to check whether the spoken answer is correct).</li>
                <li><strong>How it's handled:</strong> Audio is processed locally on the device using the device's speech recognition feature. The audio recording is not sent to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Any temporary audio file created for recognition is deleted immediately after processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note-box">
                <strong>Note:</strong> Depending on your device settings and operating system, speech recognition may be provided by your device manufacturer or platform (e.g., Google) and may be processed according to their policies.
            </div>

            <h3>2.5 Support Communications</h3>
            <p>If you contact us at <a href="mailto:tidyupgames@gmail.com">tidyupgames@gmail.com</a>, we receive the content of your message and your email address in order to respond.</p>

            <h2>3. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No ads are shown in the app.</li>
                <li>We do not use analytics SDKs (no Firebase Analytics) or crash reporting SDKs (no Crashlytics).</li>
                <li>We do not collect precise location, contacts, call/SMS data, or advertising identifiers for ads.</li>
                <li>We do not "sell" user data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Permissions We Use</h2>
            <p>TIDY UP! uses the following device permissions only to provide core functionality:</p>

            <h3>Camera (android.permission.CAMERA)</h3>
            <p>Used to capture a room photo for optional AI-powered features (e.g., item list/story/questions). Photos are not permanently stored by us and are not stored on our servers.</p>

            <h3>Microphone / Audio Recording (android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO)</h3>
            <p>Used in Math Mode so the user can speak an answer aloud. The app uses speech recognition to convert speech to text and check whether the answer is correct. Any temporary audio created for recognition is deleted immediately after processing, and audio is not uploaded to our servers. TIDY UP! does not record audio in the background and does not access the microphone unless you actively start Math Mode voice answering (e.g., by tapping the microphone button).</p>

            <h3>Internet Access (android.permission.INTERNET)</h3>
            <p>Used to connect to required services such as Google Sign-In, Google Play Billing, and the OpenAI API for AI features. Without internet access, these online features may not work.</p>
            
            <p>We do not request permission to access your contacts, precise location, or device storage for saving media. Where possible, you can deny permissions and still use parts of the app that do not require them.</p>

            <h2>5. How We Use Data</h2>
            <p>We use data for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authentication & account management (Google Sign-In)</li>
                <li>App functionality (AI photo processing and AI-generated results)</li>
                <li>Purchase verification & entitlement management (Google Play Billing)</li>
                <li>Customer support and responding to requests (email)</li>
                <li>Security and abuse prevention where necessary to protect the service</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Sharing of Data (Third Parties)</h2>
            <p>We share data only with service providers required to operate the app:</p>

            <h3>Google (Google Sign-In & Google Play Billing)</h3>
            <p>Used for authentication and purchase processing/verification.</p>

            <h3>OpenAI (AI processing via OpenAI API)</h3>
            <p>When you use AI features, the photo and related prompt are sent to OpenAI to generate the requested output. OpenAI's handling/retention depends on their API policies and settings available to developers.</p>

            <h3>Speech Recognition (Math Mode)</h3>
            <p>Speech recognition is performed using the device's built-in speech recognition service. We do not receive the raw audio on our servers. However, the platform provider's speech recognition service may handle voice data according to the user's device settings and their own privacy terms.</p>
            
            <p>We do not share data with advertising networks because the app has no ads.</p>

            <h2>7. Children's Privacy (Families)</h2>
            <p>TIDY UP! is designed for children and parents/guardians to use together. We aim to minimize data collection and use it only for the app's features. Parents/guardians should supervise use of camera-based AI features and avoid capturing identifying information. For children, we recommend parental supervision when using microphone-based features.</p>

            <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account data:</strong> kept while your account is active, and deleted when you request account deletion (see Section 9), except where we must retain limited records for legal, security, or fraud-prevention reasons.</li>
                <li><strong>Room photos:</strong> not stored on our servers and not intended to be retained after processing; they are used to produce the requested result and then deleted from the app flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Purchase records:</strong> entitlement status may be retained as needed to restore purchases and handle support.</li>
                <li><strong>Support emails:</strong> retained as long as needed to resolve the request and maintain support history.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Account Deletion</h2>
            <p>You can delete your account:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the app via the Account Deletion button, and/or</li>
                <li>Via our Account Deletion URL: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tidyupgames/delete-account?authuser=0" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/view/tidyupgames/delete-account?authuser=0</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>After account deletion, we delete your account data associated with the app, subject to any required retention for legal/security purposes.</p>

            <h2>10. Your Choices & Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You can choose whether to use AI features that involve photo processing.</li>
                <li>You can contact us for privacy requests at <a href="mailto:tidyupgames@gmail.com">tidyupgames@gmail.com</a>.</li>
                <li>Tapping the email address in the app may open your device's email app to contact support.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Security</h2>
            <p>We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards designed to protect data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

            <h2>12. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Because the app is available globally and uses third-party providers, data may be processed in countries other than where you live, depending on where you and our providers operate.</p>

            <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Effective date" at the top when changes are made.</p>
